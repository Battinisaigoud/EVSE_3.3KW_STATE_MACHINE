1.Implementated of bluetooth configaration parameters and parameters functions.
2.Bluetooth configaration parameters packet {"lowcurcnt":"200","mincurr":"0.25","ongoingtxpor":0,"otaenable":0,"onlineoffline":0}
3.Session resume on power recycle should be configurable.
a)If ongoingtxpor is enabled(1) , the charger should resume the ongoing session after power recycle.
b)If ongoingtxpor is disabled(0), the charger should send stop txn request for ongoing session with power loss as reason after power recycle with time stamp
4.4G/WiFi OTA configuration
a)If otaenable  is enabled(1), the charger will check for the OTA after power recycle.
b)If otaenable  is disabled(0), the charger should not check for the OTA after power recycle
5.Online-Offline Functionality configurable
a)If onlineoffline is  enabled(1), the charger should go to offline mode when the internet is not available and should be able to start the sessions when the RFID is tapped.
b)If onlineoffline  is disabled(0) , the char ger will be checking for the connectivity and remains in internet checking loop when the internet is not available. Offline functionality  should not work in this mode.
6.Default low current count 120 and mincur 0.25

1. Complete core profile, reserve now and ALPR integrated!
2. Fixed Session Resume after power recycle with the same transaction ID
3. Low Current count 3min
4. Low Current Threshold 100 milli amps
5. changed Master serial port baudrate from 9600 to 14400.
6. while EVSE device is charging:
    1. Connectivity is changed from Online to offline then, meter values not pushed in the OCCP out-going Message Queues.
    2. if Device restart, it will check onging transaction is exist or not, if yes then resume it, with Relay ON, green and white led blink will indicated.
    3. if Internet off and on, then it will reconnect the internet and update ocpp message to CMS and update valid meter values to CMS.
   
7. Added GSM based functionality. 
8. removed the Wifi on-Event for checking wifi-level Connectivity. 
9. Starts device charging even-though the start transaction response is ConcurrentTx.
